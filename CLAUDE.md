# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LaRaClaw is a self-hosted AI agent platform — an OpenClaw reimplementation in Laravel.
Three interaction channels: Web Chat (Inertia/React), TUI (Laravel Prompts), Email.

## Tech Stack

- PHP 8.4+, Laravel 12, Inertia 2, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- Laravel/AI SDK (`laravel/ai`) for multi-provider LLM abstraction
- Laravel Reverb for WebSocket (real-time streaming)
- SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL + pgvector (production)
- Vite 7, Laravel Reverb WebSocket hub for real-time streaming
- Bun (package manager), Pest (testing framework)

## Commands

```bash
composer dev                    # Start reverb + queue + logs + Vite (4 processes; FrankenPHP serves HTTP)
composer test                   # Run Pest test suite (clears config cache first)
vendor/bin/pest --filter=ChatTest   # Run a single test class
vendor/bin/pest --filter=test_name  # Run a single test method
bun run build                   # TypeScript check + Vite production build
bun run dev                     # Vite dev server only (use `composer dev` for full stack)
bun install                     # Install frontend dependencies
php artisan migrate             # Run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed # Reset database with default agent + user
vendor/bin/pint                 # PHP code style fixer (Laravel Pint)
```

## Architecture

### Request Flow (Web Chat — Reverb WebSocket)

1. `POST /chat/send` → `ChatController::send()` validates input, builds `IncomingMessage` DTO, dispatches `ProcessChatMessage` job, returns `{session_key}` JSON immediately
2. `ProcessChatMessage` (queued job) calls `AgentRuntime::streamAndBroadcast()`
3. `streamAndBroadcast()` resolves session, saves user message, builds agent, calls `$agent->broadcastNow()` which iterates stream events and broadcasts each via Reverb
4. SDK broadcasts `stream_start`, `text_delta` (many), `stream_end` events on `private-chat.session.{sessionKey}`
5. After streaming completes, saves assistant message, fires `SessionCreated`/`SessionUpdated` on `private-chat.user.{userId}`
6. Frontend `ChatInterface` subscribes to session channel via Laravel Echo, accumulates text deltas into React state
7. `ChatLayout` subscribes to user channel — sidebar auto-refreshes on session lifecycle events

### Core Services (`app/Services/`)
- `Agent/AgentRuntime` — Main orchestrator: sync (`handleMessage`), SSE (`streamMessage`), WebSocket (`streamAndBroadcast`)
- `Agent/SessionResolver` — Maps `IncomingMessage` to `AgentSession` (creates if needed, resolves default agent)
- `Agent/ContextAssembler` — Builds system prompt + conversation history, includes compacted summaries
- `Agent/SystemPromptBuilder` — Composes from workspace files with agent-level prompt overrides
- `Agent/ModelRegistry` — Available models filtered by configured API keys, resolves provider from model ID

### Models
- `Agent` — Agent configurations (multi-agent support, `is_default` flag, `prompt_overrides` JSON)
- `AgentSession` — Conversation sessions with channel, trust level, per-session model/provider override
- `AgentMessage` — Individual messages (append-only log, `usage` JSON for token tracking)
- `Memory` — Long-term memory entries + embeddings
- `Tool` / `ToolExecution` — Tool registry and audit log

### DCS Layout (Dual Carousel Sidebar)
Ported from LaRaDav. Glassmorphism + 5 OKLCH color schemes (crimson default, stone, ocean, forest, sunset).

- `Contexts/ThemeContext` — Theme/scheme/sidebar state, persisted to localStorage key `laraclaw-state`
- `Components/PanelCarousel` — Sliding `< [dot·dot] >` carousel for panels
- `Components/Sidebar` — Glass sidebar shell with pin/unpin, auto-unpins below 1280px
- Left panels: Navigation (L1), Conversations (L2), Agent Config (L3)
- Right panels: Theme (R1), Usage Stats (R2), Settings (R3)
- CSS: `resources/css/laraclaw.css` — OKLCH scheme vars, glassmorphism, sidebar transitions
- CSS: `resources/css/app.css` — Bridges scheme vars to Tailwind theme tokens (`--color-*`)

### Config
- `config/agent.php` — Models, providers, pricing, workspace settings, session defaults
- `config/channels.php` — Web/TUI/Email channel configs with trust levels
- `config/tools.php` — Tool policies per trust level (operator/standard/restricted)
- `config/memory.php` — Embedding and search settings

### Workspace Files (Agent Prompts)
- `storage/app/agent/AGENTS.md` — Core agent instructions
- `storage/app/agent/SOUL.md` — Personality (optional)
- `storage/app/agent/TOOLS.md` — Tool conventions (optional)
- `storage/app/agent/MEMORY.md` — Curated long-term facts (optional)
- `storage/app/agent/skills/` — Skill playbooks

## Environment

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required for default provider
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — optional
- `AI_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=anthropic`, `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- Login: markc@renta.net / changeme_N0W

## Conventions

- PascalCase directories: Pages/, Components/, Layouts/, Contexts/ (Breeze convention)
- Services in app/Services/ organized by domain
- DTOs in app/DTOs/
- Config-driven: use `config()` not `env()` outside config files
- Theme CSS vars defined in `laraclaw.css`, bridged to Tailwind in `app.css` via `@theme` block
- TypeScript types for shared Inertia props in `resources/js/types/index.d.ts`
- Streaming uses Reverb WebSocket via Laravel AI SDK `broadcastNow()` — frontend listens via Laravel Echo
- Tests use Pest with in-memory SQLite (`phpunit.xml` configures `DB_DATABASE=:memory:`)
- Package manager: Bun (not npm) — use `bun install`, `bun run build`, `bunx` for CLI tools

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 3 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, architecture testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `inertia-react-development` — Develops Inertia.js v2 React client-side applications. Activates when creating React pages, forms, or navigation; using &lt;Link&gt;, &lt;Form&gt;, useForm, or router; working with deferred props, prefetching, or polling; or when user mentions React with Inertia, React pages, React forms, or React navigation.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `bun run build`, `bun run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/Pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scrolling (merging props + `WhenVisible`), lazy loading on scroll, polling, prefetching.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `bun run build` or ask the user to run `bun run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.
